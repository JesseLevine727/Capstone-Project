Their respiratory rate is in the range of 33 to 46 breaths per minute. The body temperature has been consistent, hovering around 36.8 to 37.3°C. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels are good, mostly between 96% and 100%.\\n\\nThere have been some changes in their skin tone, ranging from normal to blueish and yellow-jaundice at times. We've been keeping a close eye on this. Interventions have included regular feedings, with volumes ranging from 15 ml to 29 ml of formula, and some medications, such as antibiotics and analgesics, have been administered as needed.\\n\\nTheir pain levels have varied, with some instances of low pain and a few moments of extreme discomfort, but we are actively managing it to keep them as comfortable as possible.\\n\\nIf you have any specific questions or need more details, feel free to ask!\""
