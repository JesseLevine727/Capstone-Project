So, let me update you on Baby Jesus' status based on the recent observations. Baby Jesus has been consistently monitored, and each time the baby was not physically present in the crib, covered with a blanket, lying in a supine position, and under low lighting conditions. Importantly, there were no interventions required, and the NIPS pain assessments consistently showed no signs of pain.

For the vital signs, Baby Jesus' heart rate has shown some fluctuations. At times, it was recorded at 134 bpm, but there were instances where it spiked to 140 bpm and dropped to as low as 107 bpm. These changes seemed to occur without any significant triggers or interventions. The respiratory rate remained stable at 40 breaths per minute throughout the observations, and the body temperature was consistently at 37Â°C, indicating no fever or hypothermia.

To sum up, while the heart rate did fluctuate, the respiratory rate and body temperature remained stable, and there were no signs of pain or distress. The fluctuations in the heart rate are something to keep an eye on, but there have been no other irregularities or concerning signs.
